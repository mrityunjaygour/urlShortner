# urlShortner

As the name suggests this package helps in creating short urls for any long input url.

What this package does is it has two end points - one for creating a short url with the input actual longer url
and another end point helps us getting original url by providing shorter url.

This package can be useful when we have some characters limit in sending a message and we want to include a url too. So instead of sending complete long url we can send short url and upon clicking this, user will be directed to original url.
